# The Carpentries Workbench Template Markdown Lesson

This lesson is a template lesson that uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].

## Note about lesson life cycle stage
Although the `config.yaml` states the life cycle stage as pre-alpha, **the template is stable and ready to use**. The life cycle stage is preset to `"pre-alpha"` as this setting is appropriate for new lessons initialised using the template.

## Create a new repository from this template

To use this template to start a new lesson repository,
make sure you're logged into Github.
Visit https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-md/generate
and follow the instructions.
Checking the 'Include all branches' option will save some time waiting for the first website build
when your new repository is initialised.

## Configure a new lesson

Follow the steps below to
complete the initial configuration of a new lesson repository built from this template:

1. **Make sure GitHub Pages is activated:**
   navigate to _Settings_,
   select _Pages_ from the left sidebar,
   and make sure that `gh-pages` is selected as the branch to build from.
   If no `gh-pages` branch is available, check _Actions_ to see if the first
   website build workflows are still running.
   The branch should become available when those have completed.
1. **Update this README with
   [relevant information about your lesson](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/collaborating-newcomers.html#readme)**
   and delete this section.
